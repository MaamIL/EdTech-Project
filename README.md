# EdTech-Project

This project is me trying to combine the world of teaching with the world of AI and deep learning.<br>
There is no sense in letting each student learn in the same pace and no reason any student will be overlooked when he doesn't meet the learning standard.<br>
A tool examining the place and pace of each student can do wonders to the individua student- to the fast, bright learners as well as to the slower ones, not neglecting the average learners as well.<br>
